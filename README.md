## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Nishit240/FaceTrack.git <br />
cd `` face-recognition-attendance-system`` 

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python -m venv .venv <br />
source .venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

``pip install -r requirements.txt`` 

### If requirements.txt doesn't exist, manually install:
``pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python pillow numpy tk``

## ✅ How It Works
#### Capture Faces:

- Add student and capture multiple face images via webcam.

#### Train the Model:

- Use ``train.py`` to process and train the data using LBPH algorithm.

#### Face Recognition:

- Launch face recognition, match faces, and auto-log attendance.

#### Attendance Logs:

- Attendance is saved in ``attendance.csv`` with student ID, name, date, and time.

## 🧠 LBPH Algorithm
This project uses the Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) face recognizer from ``opencv-contrib``. It's fast, lightweight, and works well for real-time face recognition on small datasets.

---

## 📦 Requirements
- All required libraries are listed in ``requirements.txt``, but core ones include:

- ``opencv-python``

- ``Pillow``

- ``tkinter``

- ``numpy``

- ``tkcalendar`` (if used for student entry forms)

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Reduce human error in attendance marking

- Save time with a fully automated system

- Ensure a hygienic, touchless method post-COVID

- Make the system low-cost and scalable

---

## 🛡️ Future Improvements
- Database integration (MySQL or SQLite)

- Admin login system

- Email/SMS alerts on attendance

- Detailed analytics dashboard
